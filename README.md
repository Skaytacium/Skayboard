# Skayboard

## Skaytacium's epic custom layout with 5 macro keys. Aluminium plate and case. Underglow + per key RGB. Fully customizable with QMK.

### Status

Currently, rev4 has been scrapped not due to bad layout, but rather a better way to make the key components. An idea was rev4.5, which meant having the old key components, but using Excel magic to generate the pick and place and BOM. This would have been fine, but a better way to do it would be by creating a schematic for a key which contains the LED and the capacitors and diodes and all that.

Problem with that is, its a lot of manual work and I'm way too lazy to do it, might hand it over to NNNI.

Group buy might happen in Feb due to these delays, also because I need my geekhack profile to be verified.

### Customizability

#### Skayboard is not very customizable.

It is not a board meant for someone who likes ISO Enter keys or no windows keys, nor does it have the option to change that. The reason why is not because it is any harder to implement but rather because its *Skayboard* and not meant for everyone. If you do like the layout, be sure to keep up with this repo for any further updates.

### Parts used

Skayboard uses SK6812 Mini-E LEDs for both, per-key RGB and underglow. This is due to multiple reasons, including having only one pin for LEDs therefore a cleaner PCB and also because their name starts with 'SK'.

Diodes used are 1N4148 SMD type diodes, capacitors are MLCC SMD. Skayboard is not meant for hand soldering (except for the switches) therefore it does not use 0603 components, rather uses 0402. If you are brave enough to solder that, make sure to send me pictures on my Discord (`Skaytacium#1337`).

An aluminium plate is used due to its sound profile and rigidity. Case is also made out of aluminium except for an engraved logo on the bottom.

### Prototype pictures

Soon.

### Progress updates

Most progress is documented here now, on this README, but if you have enquiries or question, you can contact me on my Discord.

### Price

#### Skayboard is not a complete keyboard.

It is only the case, plate and PCB. You will have to buy switches and keycaps and any other accessories yourself. You will also have to solder the switches yourself.

As our current PCB Manufacturer doesn't offer LED soldering the way we want it and doesn't have the mentioned LEDs in stock, there will be seperate charges for underglow and per-key RGB.

(**This is subject to change, please don't consider this to be the final price.**) The current price is about 50$ (without any LEDs) to 90$ (with per-key RGB and underglow).
